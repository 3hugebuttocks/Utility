    <string name="description">A home or domicile is a dwelling-place used as a permanent
        or semi-permanent residence for an individual, family, household or several families in a
        tribe. It is often a house, apartment, or other building, or alternatively a mobile home,
        houseboat, yurt or any other portable shelter. Homes typically provide areas and facilities for
        sleeping, preparing food, eating and hygiene. Larger groups may live in a nursing home,
        children's home, convent or any similar institution. A homestead also includes agricultural
        land and facilities for domesticated animals. Where more secure dwellings are not available, people may live in the informal and sometimes illegal shacks found in slums and shanty towns. More generally,
        "home" may be considered to be a geographic area, such as a town, village, suburb, city, or country.</string>
